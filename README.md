# R5RS-CrashCourse
This is a crashcourse on certain commands in scheme R5RS.

The program I will be using is DrRacket, which can be downloaded at http://racket-lang.org/

This is a crash course to serve as basic information on scheme commands for the upcoming class CSC 33500 Programming Language Paradigms.
